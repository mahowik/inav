# This fork configured for STM32F4DISCOVERY (STM32F407 MCU) board + GY-86(MPU6050/HMC5883/MS5611) sensors + RC PPM

- to build hex use MATEKF405 target (in command line: ./build.sh MATEKF405)
- you can also find pre-builded hex file at "build/" folder: inav_4.1.0_STM32F4Discovery_GY-86_PPM_by_MATEKF405_target.hex   
- if there is an issue with MPU6050 i2c init on 400KHz please make full erase -> upload inav_4.1.0_STM32F4Discovery-upload_if_mpu6050_i2c_400KHz_issue.hex first -> change i2c speed to 800 KHz at INAV Configurator -> upload inav_4.1.0_STM32F4Discovery_GY-86_PPM_by_MATEKF405_target.hex again
- see src/main/target/MATEKF405/target.h for pinout or type "resource" command at inav CLI
